# Data Science Project Fall 2018

This is the final exam for Daniel Aspvik, Preben Aspvik and ??rjan Myrland in BED-2056 at UIT. The course is an introduction course for data science and this project is the final and most important part of our portfolio. The goal of the project is to go through the complete data science process to answer questions we have established ourself. The project will be a project that works through the entire data science process, by acquiring and manipulating data, designing visualizations, statistical analysis, and communicating and presenting the results.


## Project Team

Daniel Aspvik, Preben Aspvik and ??rjan Myrland


## Milestones 

Form a team and submit a project proposal due Monday September 17 at 16:00.
Project review meetings/approval, week 38/39.
Project presentation, Monday December 3 at HHT 02.217 12:15.
R/RMarkdown and compiled code due Monday December 10 at 16:00.
Project webpage and screencast due Monday December 10 at 16:00.


## RMarkdown and HTML Files

An important part of the project is the RMarkdown and compiled HTML files. These files will detail our steps in developing the solution, including how we collected the data, alternative solutions we tried, describing statistical methods we used, and the insights we gained. Equally important to a final results is a description on how we got there. Our RMarkdown and HTML files are the place we describe and document the space of possibilities we explored at each step of the project. There should be plenty of visualizations.


## RMarkdown should include the following topics presentet by the assignment:

Overview and Motivation: Provide an overview of the project goals and the motivation for it. Consider that this will be read by people who did not see your project proposal.
Related Work: Anything that inspired you, such as a paper, a web site, or something we discussed in class.
Initial Questions: What questions are you trying to answer? How did these questions evolve over the course of the project? What new questions did you consider in the course of your analysis?
Data: Source, scraping method, cleanup, etc.
Exploratory Analysis: What visualizations did you use to look at your data in different ways? What are the different statistical methods you considered? Justify the decisions you made, and show any major changes to your ideas. How did you reach these conclusions?
Final Analysis: What did you learn about the data? How did you answer the questions? How can you justify your answers?
As this will be your only chance to describe your project in detail, make sure that your RMarkdown file and compiled HTML file are standalone documents that fully describe your process and results.


## R Code

We are expect to write high-quality and readable R code in our RMarkdown file. We strive for doing things the right way and think about aspects such as reproducibility, efficiency, cleaning data, etc. We must be able to document the code.


## Project Website

The project will be presentet on a public Github Page. The web site should effectively summarize the main results of the project and tell a story. We should consider our audience and keep the level of discussion at an appropriate level. The main visualizations and screencast should be in this website.


## Project Screencast presentet by the assignment:

Each project/team will create a two minute screencast with narration showing a demo of your project and/or some slides. You could google ???how to make screencast??? or use the same search word in youtube. A free web-based screencast software is found here. Make sure the sound quality of your video is good. Upload the video to an online video-platform such as YouTube or Vimeo and embed it into your project web page.

We will strictly enforce the two minute time limit for the video, so please make sure you are not running longer. Use principles of good storytelling and presentations to get your key points across. Focus the majority of your screencast on your main contributions rather than on technical details. What do you feel is the best part of your project? What insights did you gain? What is the single most important thing you would like your audience to take away?


## Submission instructions presentet by the assignment:

Submit the RMarkdown and HTML files that generates the projects website and screencast by Monday december 10 at 16:00. Create a GitHub repository which should include the data used for the final project, the RMarkdown file and the compiled HTML file. If the data are too big to fit in the repository, make the data accessible somewhere online (google drive, dropbox, downloadable link, etc). Inside the RMarkdown file at the top, include instructions on where to access the data. If we cannot access your work or links because these directions are not followed correctly, we will not grade your work.

You should only have one GitHub repository per project/team, but make sure the names of all group members are inside the RMarkdown file at the top. E-mail instructions on where to access the data and the location of your GitHub repository.


## Project Presentation presentet by the assignment:

Each group will present their project in a 10???15 minute presentation to the class. Presentations should clearly convey the project ideas, methods, and results, including the question(s) being addressed, the motivation of the analyses being employed, and relevant evaluations, contributions, and discussion questions.


## Grading presentet by the assignment:

The final grade will be given based on all contributed parts in your portfolio.

This includes the Project Proposal, the RMarkdown and HTML files in your GitHub repository. We will review the quality of your data analysis and R code, the complexity and level of difficulty of your project, completeness and overall functionality of your analysis. Also we will assess the project presentation, your web site and the screencast and the quality of the storytelling aspects.


## The project proposal will be evaluated by the following criterias:

Title of Project: What's the title of the project?
Project Plan: What do you plan to do?
Data Sources: What data do you plan to use? From where will this data come?

## The project data sources

This project contains multiple sources of data and datasets:

-VSRR Provisional Drug Overdose Death Counts

The main source of data is contained in this dataset. It contains provisional counts for drug overdose deaths based on a current flow of mortality data in the National Vital Statistics System. National provisional counts include deaths occurring within the 50 states and the District of Columbia as of the date specified and may not include all deaths that occurred during a given time period. Provisional counts are often incomplete and causes of death may be pending investigation resulting in an underestimate relative to final counts.

-State population 2015 - Infoplease

In this dataset we import the total population of each state in the United States for year 2015. Infoplease uses the U.S. Census Bureau, Population Division as a source for their numbers.

-State population 2016 - Dilemma X

In this dataset we import the total population of each state in the United States for year 2016. Dilemma X uses the U.S. Census Bureau, Population Division as a source for their numbers.

-State population 2017 - Wikipedia

In this dataset we import the total population of each state in the United States for year 2017. Wikipedia uses the U.S. Census Bureau, Population Division as a source for their numbers.

-State population 2018 - World Population Review

In this dataset we import the total population of each state in the United States for year 2017. World Population Review uses the U.S. Census Bureau, Population Division as a source for their numbers.

-Local Area Unemployment Statistics

We import the datasets for the different years from the U.S. Department of Labor.
They contain the annual averages of unemployment rates for the States.

-Average Annual Sunshine by State

This dataset shows the average amount of sunshine that each US state has.
Current Results uses the National Climatic Data Center and World Data Center for Meteorology  as a source for their numbers.

-Average Annual Temperature for Each US State

This dataset shows the average temperature that each US state has.
The temperatures collected by Current Results are based on data collected by weather stations throughout each state during the years 1971 to 2000 and made available by the NOAA National Climatic Data Center of the United States.

-Average Annual Precipitation by State

This dataset shows the average precipitation that each US state has.
The precipitation averages are based on data collected by weather stations throughout each state from 1971 to 2000 and provided by the NOAA National Climatic Data Center.

-Median Household income

The dataset contains the median household income of all the states in the United States.
The incomes collected by Data USA are based on data from the Census Bureau

-List of Latitudes and Longitudes for Every State

The dataset from Ink Plant contains the latitudes and longitudes for every state in the United States
